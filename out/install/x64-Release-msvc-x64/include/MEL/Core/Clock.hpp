// CLASS DOCUMENTATION
//==============================================================================

/// \class mel::Clock
/// \ingroup utility
///
/// mel::Clock is a lightweight class for measuring time.
///
/// Its provides the most precise time that the underlying
/// OS can achieve (generally microseconds or nanoseconds).
/// It also ensures monotonicity, which means that the returned
/// time can never go backward, even if the system time is
/// changed.
///
/// Usage example:
/// \code
/// mel::Clock clock;
/// ...
/// Time time1 = clock.getElapsedTime();
/// ...
/// Time time2 = clock.restart();
/// \endcode
///
/// The mel::Time value returned by the clock can then be
/// converted to a number of seconds, milliseconds or even
/// microseconds.
///
/// \see mel::Time

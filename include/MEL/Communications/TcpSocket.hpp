/// \class mel::TcpSocket
/// \ingroup Communications
///
/// TCP is a connected protocol, which means that a TCP
/// socket can only communicate with the host it is connected
/// to. It can't send or receive anything if it is not connected.
///
/// The TCP protocol is reliable but adds a slight overhead.
/// It ensures that your data will always be received in order
/// and without errors (no data corrupted, lost or duplicated).
///
/// When a socket is connected to a remote host, you can
/// retrieve informations about this host with the
/// get_remote_address and get_remote_port functions. You can
/// also get the local port to which the socket is bound
/// (which is automatically chosen when the socket is connected),
/// with the get_local_port function.
///
/// Sending and receiving data can use either the low-level
/// or the high-level functions. The low-level functions
/// process a raw sequence of bytes, and cannot ensure that
/// one call to Send will exactly match one call to Receive
/// at the other end of the socket.
///
/// The high-level interface uses packets (see mel::Packet),
/// which are easier to use and provide more safety regarding
/// the data that is exchanged. You can look at the mel::Packet
/// class to get more details about how they work.
///
/// The socket is automatically disconnected when it is destroyed,
/// but if you want to explicitly close the connection while
/// the socket instance is still alive, you can call disconnect.
///
/// Usage example:
/// \code
/// // ----- The client -----
///
/// // Create a socket and connect it to 192.168.1.50 on port 55001
/// mel::TcpSocket socket;
/// socket.connect("192.168.1.50", 55001);
///
/// // Send a message to the connected host
/// std::string message = "Hi, I am a client";
/// socket.send(message.c_str(), message.size() + 1);
///
/// // Receive an answer from the server
/// char buffer[1024];
/// std::size_t received = 0;
/// socket.receive(buffer, sizeof(buffer), received);
/// std::cout << "The server said: " << buffer << std::endl;
///
/// // ----- The server -----
///
/// // Create a listener to wait for incoming connections on port 55001
/// mel::TcpListener listener;
/// listener.listen(55001);
///
/// // Wait for a connection
/// mel::TcpSocket socket;
/// listener.accept(socket);
/// std::cout << "New client connected: " << socket.get_remote_address() <<
/// std::endl;
///
/// // Receive a message from the client
/// char buffer[1024];
/// std::size_t received = 0;
/// socket.receive(buffer, sizeof(buffer), received);
/// std::cout << "The client said: " << buffer << std::endl;
///
/// // Send an answer
/// std::string message = "Welcome, client";
/// socket.send(message.c_str(), message.size() + 1);
/// \endcode
///

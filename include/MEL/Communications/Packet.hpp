//==============================================================================
// CLASS DOCUMENTATION
//==============================================================================

/// \class mel::Packet
/// \ingroup network
///
/// Packets provide a safe and easy way to serialize data,
/// in order to send it over the network using sockets
/// (mel::TcpSocket, mel::UdpSocket).
///
/// Packets solve 2 fundamental problems that arise when
/// tranmelerring data over the network:
/// \li data is interpreted correctly according to the endianness
/// \li the bounds of the packet are preserved (one send == one receive)
///
/// The mel::Packet class provides both input and output modes.
/// It is designed to follow the behavior of standard C++ streams,
/// using operators >> and << to extract and insert data.
///
/// It is recommended to use only fixed-size types (like mel::int32, etc.),
/// to avoid possible differences between the sender and the receiver.
/// Indeed, the native C++ types may have different sizes on two platforms
/// and your data may be corrupted if that happens.
///
/// Usage example:
/// \code
/// mel::uint32 x = 24;
/// std::string s = "hello";
/// double d = 5.89;
///
/// // Group the variables to send into a packet
/// mel::Packet packet;
/// packet << x << s << d;
///
/// // Send it over the network (socket is a valid mel::TcpSocket)
/// socket.send(packet);
///
/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
///
/// // Receive the packet at the other end
/// mel::Packet packet;
/// socket.receive(packet);
///
/// // Extract the variables contained in the packet
/// mel::uint32 x;
/// std::string s;
/// double d;
/// if (packet >> x >> s >> d)
/// {
///     // Data extracted successfullyly...
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// Packets have built-in operator >> and << overloads for
/// standard types:
/// \li bool
/// \li fixed-size integer types (mel::int8/16/32, mel::uint8/16/32)
/// \li floating point numbers (float, double)
/// \li string types (char*, wchar_t*, std::string, std::wstring, mel::String)
///
/// Like standard streams, it is also possible to define your own
/// overloads of operators >> and << in order to handle your
/// custom types.
///
/// \code
/// struct MyStruct
/// {
///     float       number;
///     mel::int8    integer;
///     std::string str;
/// };
///
/// mel::Packet& operator <<(mel::Packet& packet, const MyStruct& m)
/// {
///     return packet << m.number << m.integer << m.str;
/// }
///
/// mel::Packet& operator >>(mel::Packet& packet, MyStruct& m)
/// {
///     return packet >> m.number >> m.integer >> m.str;
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// Packets also provide an extra feature that allows to apply
/// custom tranmelormations to the data before it is sent,
/// and after it is received. This is typically used to
/// handle automatic compression or encryption of the data.
/// This is achieved by inheriting from mel::Packet, and overriding
/// the on_send and on_receive functions.
///
/// Here is an example:
/// \code
/// class ZipPacket : public mel::Packet
/// {
///     virtual const void* on_send(std::size_t& size)
///     {
///         const void* srcData = get_data();
///         std::size_t srcSize = get_data_size();
///
///         return MySuperZipFunction(srcData, srcSize, &size);
///     }
///
///     virtual void on_receive(const void* data, std::size_t size)
///     {
///         std::size_t dstSize;
///         const void* dstData = MySuperUnzipFunction(data, size, &dstSize);
///
///         append(dstData, dstSize);
///     }
/// };
///
/// // Use like regular packets:
/// ZipPacket packet;
/// packet << x << s << d;
/// ...
/// \endcode
///
/// \see mel::TcpSocket, mel::UdpSocket

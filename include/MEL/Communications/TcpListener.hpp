/// \class mel::TcpListener
/// \ingroup Communications
///
/// A listener socket is a special type of socket that listens to
/// a given port and waits for connections on that port.
/// This is all it can do.
///
/// When a new connection is received, you must call accept and
/// the listener returns a new instance of mel::TcpSocket that
/// is properly initialized and can be used to communicate with
/// the new client.
///
/// Listener sockets are specific to the TCP protocol,
/// UDP sockets are connectionless and can therefore communicate
/// directly. As a consequence, a listener socket will always
/// return the new connections as mel::TcpSocket instances.
///
/// A listener is automatically closed on destruction, like all
/// other types of socket. However if you want to stop listening
/// before the socket is destroyed, you can call its close()
/// function.
///
/// Usage example:
/// \code
/// // Create a listener socket and make it wait for new
/// // connections on port 55001
/// mel::TcpListener listener;
/// listener.listen(55001);
///
/// // Endless loop that waits for new connections
/// while (running)
/// {
///     mel::TcpSocket client;
///     if (listener.accept(client) == mel::Socket::Done)
///     {
///         // A new client just connected!
///         std::cout << "New connection received from " <<
///         client.getRemoteAddress() << std::endl; doSomethingWith(client);
///     }
/// }
/// \endcode

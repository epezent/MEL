/// \class mel::UdpSocket
/// \ingroup Communications
///
/// A UDP socket is a connectionless socket. Instead of
/// connecting once to a remote host, like TCP sockets,
/// it can send to and receive from any host at any time.
///
/// It is a datagram protocol: bounded blocks of data (datagrams)
/// are tranmelered over the network rather than a continuous
/// stream of data (TCP). Therefore, one call to send will always
/// match one call to receive (if the datagram is not lost),
/// with the same data that was sent.
///
/// The UDP protocol is lightweight but unreliable. Unreliable
/// means that datagrams may be duplicated, be lost or
/// arrive reordered. However, if a datagram arrives, its
/// data is guaranteed to be valid.
///
/// UDP is generally used for real-time communication
/// (audio or video streaming, real-time games, etc.) where
/// speed is crucial and lost data doesn't matter much.
///
/// Sending and receiving data can use either the low-level
/// or the high-level functions. The low-level functions
/// process a raw sequence of bytes, whereas the high-level
/// interface uses packets (see mel::Packet), which are easier
/// to use and provide more safety regarding the data that is
/// exchanged. You can look at the mel::Packet class to get
/// more details about how they work.
///
/// It is important to note that UdpSocket is unable to send
/// datagrams bigger than MaxDatagramSize. In this case, it
/// returns an error and doesn't send anything. This applies
/// to both raw data and packets. Indeed, even packets are
/// unable to split and recompose data, due to the unreliability
/// of the protocol (dropped, mixed or duplicated datagrams may
/// lead to a big mess when trying to recompose a packet).
///
/// If the socket is bound to a port, it is automatically
/// unbound from it when the socket is destroyed. However,
/// you can unbind the socket explicitly with the Unbind
/// function if necessary, to stop receiving messages or
/// make the port available for other sockets.
///
/// Usage example:
/// \code
/// // ----- The client -----
///
/// // Create a socket and bind it to the port 55001
/// mel::UdpSocket socket;
/// socket.bind(55001);
///
/// // Send a message to 192.168.1.50 on port 55002
/// std::string message = "Hi, I am " +
/// mel::IpAddress::getLocalAddress().toString(); socket.send(message.c_str(),
/// message.size() + 1, "192.168.1.50", 55002);
///
/// // Receive an answer (most likely from 192.168.1.50, but could be anyone
/// else) char buffer[1024]; std::size_t received = 0; mel::IpAddress sender;
/// unsigned short port;
/// socket.receive(buffer, sizeof(buffer), received, sender, port);
/// std::cout << sender.ToString() << " said: " << buffer << std::endl;
///
/// // ----- The server -----
///
/// // Create a socket and bind it to the port 55002
/// mel::UdpSocket socket;
/// socket.bind(55002);
///
/// // Receive a message from anyone
/// char buffer[1024];
/// std::size_t received = 0;
/// mel::IpAddress sender;
/// unsigned short port;
/// socket.receive(buffer, sizeof(buffer), received, sender, port);
/// std::cout << sender.ToString() << " said: " << buffer << std::endl;
///
/// // Send an answer
/// std::string message = "Welcome " + sender.toString();
/// socket.send(message.c_str(), message.size() + 1, sender, port);
/// \endcode
///

// CLASS DOCUMENTATION
//==============================================================================

/// \class mel::IpAddress
/// \ingroup network
///
/// mel::IpAddress is a utility class for manipulating network
/// addresses. It provides a set a implicit constructors and
/// conversion functions to easily build or tranmelorm an IP
/// address from/to various representations.
///
/// Usage example:
/// \code
/// mel::IpAddress a0;                                       // an invalid
/// address mel::IpAddress a1 = mel::IpAddress::None;                 // an
/// invalid address (same as a0) mel::IpAddress a2("127.0.0.1");
/// // the local host address mel::IpAddress a3 = mel::IpAddress::Broadcast;
/// // the broadcast address mel::IpAddress a4(192, 168, 1, 56);
/// // a local address mel::IpAddress a5("my_computer");
/// // a local address created from a network name mel::IpAddress
/// a6("89.54.1.169");                        // a distant address
/// mel::IpAddress a7("www.google.com");                     // a distant
/// address created from a network name mel::IpAddress a8 =
/// mel::IpAddress::get_local_address();  // my address on the local network
/// mel::IpAddress a9 = mel::IpAddress::get_public_address(); // my address on
/// the internet \endcode
///
/// Note that mel::IpAddress currently doesn't support IPv6
/// nor other types of network addresses.

/// \class mel::Mutex
/// \ingroup system
///
/// Mutex stands for "MUTual EXclusion". A mutex is a
/// synchronization object, used when multiple threads are involved.
///
/// When you want to protect a part of the code from being accessed
/// simultaneously by multiple threads, you typically use a
/// mutex. When a thread is locked by a mutex, any other thread
/// trying to lock it will be blocked until the mutex is released
/// by the thread that locked it. This way, you can allow only
/// one thread at a time to access a critical region of your code.
///
/// Usage example:
/// \code
/// Database database; // this is a critical resource that needs some protection
/// mel::Mutex mutex;
///
/// void thread1()
/// {
///     mutex.lock(); // this call will block the thread if the mutex is already
///     locked by thread2 database.write(...); mutex.unlock(); // if thread2 was
///     waiting, it will now be unblocked
/// }
///
/// void thread2()
/// {
///     mutex.lock(); // this call will block the thread if the mutex is already
///     locked by thread1 database.write(...); mutex.unlock(); // if thread1 was
///     waiting, it will now be unblocked
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// Be very careful with mutexes. A bad usage can lead to bad problems,
/// like deadlocks (two threads are waiting for each other and the
/// application is globally stuck).
///
/// To make the usage of mutexes more robust, particularly in
/// environments where exceptions can be thrown, you should
/// use the helper class mel::Lock to lock/unlock mutexes.
///
/// MEL mutexes are recursive, which means that you can lock
/// a mutex multiple times in the same thread without creating
/// a deadlock. In this case, the first call to lock() behaves
/// as usual, and the following ones have no effect.
/// However, you must call unlock() exactly as many times as you
/// called lock(). If you don't, the mutex won't be released.
///
/// \see mel::Lock

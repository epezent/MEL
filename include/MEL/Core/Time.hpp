// CLASS DOCUMENTATION
//==============================================================================

/// \class mel::Time
/// \ingroup system
///
/// mel::Time encapsulates a time value in a flexible way.
/// It allows to define a time value either as a number of
/// seconds, milliseconds or microseconds. It also works the
/// other way round: you can read a time value as either
/// a number of seconds, milliseconds or microseconds.
///
/// By using such a flexible interface, the API doesn't
/// impose any fixed type or resolution for time values,
/// and let the user choose its own favorite representation.
///
/// Time values support the usual mathematical operations:
/// you can add or subtract two times, multiply or divide
/// a time by a number, compare two times, etc.
///
/// Since they represent a time span and not an absolute time
/// value, times can also be negative.
///
/// Usage example:
/// \code
/// mel::Time t1 = mel::seconds(0.1f);
/// int32 milli = t1.as_milliseconds(); // 100
///
/// mel::Time t2 = mel::milliseconds(30);
/// int64 micro = t2.as_microseconds(); // 30000
///
/// mel::Time t3 = mel::microseconds(-800000);
/// double sec = t3.as_seconds(); // -0.8
/// \endcode
///
/// \code
/// void update(mel::Time elapsed)
/// {
///    position += speed * elapsed.as_seconds();
/// }
///
/// update(mel::milliseconds(100));
/// \endcode
///
/// \see mel::Clock, mel::Timer, mel::seconds, mel::milliseconds,
/// mel::microseconds

/// \class mel::Timer
/// \ingroup Utility
///
/// mel::Timer is a lightweight class for creating waitable fixed rate timers
///
/// You can use it to create fixed rate loops or waiting periods. It is built on
/// top of mel::Clock so it uses the most precise time that the underlying OS
/// can achieve and insures monotonicity. There are three waiting modes that can
/// be used: Busy, Sleep, and Hybrid. Busy is the most accurate, but uses 100%
/// of CPU time on the current thread. For high rate loops on Windows platforms
/// (>1000 Hz) this is the only accurate option. Sleep is the least accurate
/// option, but frees the CPU to the operating system for the entire wait
/// period. Use Sleep when accuracy is not critical. Hybrid combines the best of
/// both, Sleeping for the first 90% of the remaining wait time and Busy waiting
/// for the last 10%. Prefer Hybrid wait on real-time Linux operating systems.
///
/// Usage example:
/// \code
/// // create a 1000 Hz timer that uses a Busy waiting mode
/// mel::Timer my_timer(mel::milliseconds(1), Timer::WaitMode::Busy);
/// while(condition) {
///     // code that executes in less that 1 ms
///     ...
///     // wait the remaining time until 1 ms achieved
///     my_timer.wait();
/// }
/// ...
/// my_timer.restart();
/// while(my_timer.get_elapsed_time() < mel::seconds(10)) {
///     ...
///     my_timer.wait();
/// }
/// \endcode
